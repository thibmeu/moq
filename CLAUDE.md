# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

MoQ (Media over QUIC) is a next-generation live media delivery protocol providing real-time latency at massive scale. It's a polyglot monorepo with Rust (server/native) and TypeScript/JavaScript (browser) implementations.

## Common Development Commands

```bash
# Code quality and testing
just check        # Run all tests and linting
just fix          # Auto-fix linting issues
just build        # Build all packages
```

## Architecture

The project contains multiple layers of protocols:

1. **quic** - Does all the networking.
2. **web-transport** - A small layer on top of QUIC/HTTP3 for browser support. Provided by the browser or the `web-transport` crates.
3. **moq-lite** - A generic pub/sub protocol on top of `web-transport` implemented by CDNs, splitting content into:
    - broadcast: a collection of tracks produced by a publisher
    - track: a live stream of groups within a broadcast.
    - group: a live stream of frames within a track, each delivered independently over a QUIC stream.
    - frame: a sized payload of bytes.
4. **hang** - Media-specific encoding/decoding on top of `moq-lite`. Contains:
    - catalog: a JSON track containing a description of other tracks and their properties (for WebCodecs).
    - container: each frame consists of a timestamp and codec bitstream
5. **application** - Users building on top of `moq-lite` or `hang`

Key architectural rule: The CDN/relay does not know anything about media. Anything in the `moq` layer should be generic, using rules on the wire on how to deliver content.

```

## Development Tips

1. The project uses `just` as the task runner - check `justfile` for all available commands
2. For Rust development, the workspace is configured in the `rs/Cargo.toml`
3. For JS/TS development, bun workspaces are used with configuration in `js/package.json`
4. Try to keep stuff out of the root unless necessary; scope tools to specific languages.

## Testing Approach

- Run `just check` to execute all tests and linting.
- Run `just fix` to automatically fix formating and easy things.
- Rust tests are integrated within source files

## Workflow

When making changes to the codebase:
1. Make your code changes
2. Run `just fix` to auto-format and fix linting issues
3. Run `just check` to verify everything passes
4. Commit and push changes
